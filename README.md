# Document Store

Sample .Net 7 Blazor Server web application that relies on Entity Framework for its ORM, SQL Server File Table to store documentation, and uses the Open Id Connect protocol to connect with Azure AD and provide both external and internal users with secure single sign on and protect resources with policy based authorisation. 
As a sample application, a few example unit tests have been included, which do not constitute the full suite of tests that would be expected in a production application.
